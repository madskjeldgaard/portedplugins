CATEGORIES::UGens>VirtualAnalog

DESCRIPTION::

This plugin is an analog tape emulation algorithm by Jatin Chowdhury, a mini version of the mindblowing link::https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogLossModel##AnalogLossModel vst plugin by the same::. For a deep dive, link::https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/420/tape/TapeModel_DAFx.pdf##see Chowdhury's paper on analog tape modelling::. This smaller version is mostly useful as a tape saturation/distortion.

The plugin's guts feature variable oversampling and anti aliasing filters to achieve high quality distortion.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD::ar

ARGUMENT::input
Audio input

ARGUMENT::gap
Tape bias. 0.0 to 1.0.

ARGUMENT::thick
Tape saturation. 0.0 to 1.0 but may be pushed harder.

ARGUMENT::space
Tape drive. 0.0 to 1.0 but may be pushed harder.

ARGUMENT::speed
Set amount of oversampling

0 = No oversampling,
1 = x2,
2 = x4,
3 = x8,
4 = x16

ARGUMENT::mode
Change the mode (solver type) of the tape algorithm:
0 = RK2 (2nd order Runge Kutta)
1 = RK4 (4th order Runge Kutta)
2 = NR4 (4-iteration Newton Raphson)
3 = NR8 (8-iteration Newton Raphson)

The Runge-Kutta solvers are computationally cheaper, but
somewhat less accurate than the Newton-Raphson solvers.
Similarly, the higher-order solvers will be more accurate,
but will also consume more compute resources.


EXAMPLES::

code::
Ndef(\notam, {|freq=110, width=0.5|
	var sig = VarSaw.ar(freq, width: width);
	AnalogLoss.ar(sig);
}).play;
