RELATED::HelpSource/Overview/PortedPlugins
CATEGORIES::UGens>VirtualAnalog

DESCRIPTION::

This plugin is an analog tape emulation algorithm by Jatin Chowdhury, a mini version of the mindblowing link::https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogChewModel##AnalogChewModel vst plugin by the same::. For a deep dive, link::https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/420/tape/TapeModel_DAFx.pdf##see Chowdhury's paper on analog tape modelling::. This smaller version is mostly useful as a tape saturation/distortion.

The plugin's guts feature variable oversampling and anti aliasing filters to achieve high quality distortion.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD::ar

ARGUMENT::input
Audio input

ARGUMENT::depth
Tape bias. 0.0 to 1.0.

ARGUMENT::freq
Tape saturation. 0.0 to 1.0 but may be pushed harder.

ARGUMENT::variance
Tape drive. 0.0 to 1.0 but may be pushed harder.


EXAMPLES::

code::
Ndef(\notam, {|freq=110, width=0.5|
	var sig = VarSaw.ar(freq, width: width);
	AnalogChew.ar(sig);
}).play;
