CLASS:: VadimFilter
SUMMARY:: Vadim Zavalishin's virtual analog filters
RELATED::Classes/LPF, Classes/RLPF, Classes/RHPF
CATEGORIES::UGens>Filters>Linear

DESCRIPTION::

This UGen contains virtual analog low pass, band pass and high pass filters based on the ground breaking work of Vadim Zavalishin (LINK::https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/downloads/pdf/VAFilterDesign_1.1.1.pdf::). The filters here are fairly cheap in CPU usage and behaves well throughout the frequency spectrum and under modulation.

Ported from LINK::https://codeberg.org/nonmateria/folderkit::.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD::ar

ARGUMENT::input
Audio input

ARGUMENT::freq
Cutoff / center frequency (depending on type) in herz. May be modulated at control rate.

ARGUMENT::resonance
Resonance. Range: 0.0 to 1.0.

ARGUMENT::type
An integer that sets the filter up as one of the following types:
0 = LPF2
1 = LPF4
2 = BPF2
3 = BPF4
4 = HPF2
5 = HPF4

EXAMPLES::

code::
(
// Random LPF 4
Ndef(\va, { |freq=150|
	var in = Saw.ar(freq);

	VadimFilter.ar(
		input: in,
		type: 1,
		freq: LFNoise2.kr(10).exprange(20.0,20000.0),
		resonance: LFNoise2.kr(1).range(0.0,1.0)
	)!2
}).play;
)
